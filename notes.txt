 * Occasionally, starting Cytoscape hangs. The startup splash window will say "Initializing OSGi Container" and no red bar will move across the screen. If 
       this condition persists for more than, say, 10 seconds, it is hung. Just kill it and re-open. This happens maybe 1/10 times.

 * Closing the statistics window is permanent for that sequence of ratings. User will have start a new search to get a new statistics window.

 * Right clicking on an edge can sometimes miss the edge and show the menu for the background instead. Correctly right-clicking on an edge will
       result in the menu option "Active Search Edge Options". Missing the edge will result in the menu option "ActiveSearch"

 * If, after making some selections, the main Cytoscape window shows no edges or nodes, try zooming out; perhaps it was zoomed in to an old email's node cluster

 * The first time the big email window is displayed, it has to load in the matrix files which takes ~45 seconds. This appears to look like a hang but it is working.
       Time permitting, we'll add a popup window to indicate this.

 * The first recommendation incurs some extra math and the program will appear to hang for ~15 seconds while it works.

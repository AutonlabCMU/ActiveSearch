There are two components: The Daemon which exports its API via REST
and the CytoscapeApp which is an optional GUI. 

To get started, see the howtorun.txt file in the Daemon directory.




This step is not required, but the default jblas library is not
multithreaded. The multithreaded library will only run correctly on
the machine that it is built on, and the machine must be idle when the
package is built. This will take about an hour to complete all of the
steps.
 1. Download the latest release of the jblas source: http://mikiobraun.github.io/jblas/
 2. Unzip the source file and follow the steps in the BUILDING_ATLAS file 
Notes for 64 bit linux:
 - When building lapack, do make -k lib in addition to blaslib and lapacklib
 - After building atlas:
    cd into lib
    run "make ptshared" 
 - Add --ptatlas when building jblas
 - Add your new jar to the maven repository, overwriting the existing jar with 
    mvn install:install-file -Dfile=jblas-1.2.3.jar -DgroupId=org.jblas -DartifactId=jblas -Dversion=1.2.3 -Dpackaging=jar
